Use this API to implement requestable object functionality.
With this functionality in place, administrators can determine which access items can be requested with the [Access Request APIs](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/beta/access-requests), along with their statuses.
This can be helpful for administrators who are implementing and customizing access request functionality as a way of checking which items are requestable as they are created, assigned, and made available.




```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
