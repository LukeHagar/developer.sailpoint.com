Workflows allow administrators to create custom automation scripts directly within IdentityNow.  These automation scripts respond to [event triggers](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/docs/event-triggers#how-to-get-started-with-event-triggers) and perform a series of actions to perform tasks that are either too cumbersome or not available in the IdentityNow UI.  Workflows can be configured via a graphical user interface within IdentityNow, or by creating and uploading a JSON formatted script to the Workflow service.  The Workflows API collection provides the necessary functionality to create, manage, and test your workflows via REST.
