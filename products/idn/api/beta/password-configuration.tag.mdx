Use this API to implement organization password configuration functionality.
With this functionality in place, organization administrators can create organization-specific password configurations.

These configurations include details like custom password instructions, as well as digit token length and duration.

Refer to [Configuring User Authentication for Password Resets](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/pwd/pwd_reset.html) for more information about organization password configuration functionality.
