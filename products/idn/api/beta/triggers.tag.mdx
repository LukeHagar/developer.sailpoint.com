Event Triggers provide real-time updates to changes in IdentityNow so you can take action as soon as an event occurs, rather than poll an API endpoint for updates. IdentityNow provides a user interface within the admin console to create and manage trigger subscriptions.  These endpoints allow for programatically creating and managing trigger subscriptions.

There are two types of event triggers:
  * `FIRE_AND_FORGET`: This trigger type will send a payload to each subscriber without needing a response.  Each trigger of this type has a limit of **50 subscriptions**.
  * `REQUEST_RESPONSE`: This trigger type will send a payload to a subscriber and expect a response back.  Each trigger of this type may only have **one subscription**.

## Available Event Triggers
Production ready event triggers that are available in all tenants.
