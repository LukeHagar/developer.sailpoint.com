Use this API to implement account aggregation progress tracking functionality.
With this functionality in place, administrators can view in-progress account aggregations, their statuses, and their relevant details.

An account aggregation refers to the process IdentityNow uses to gather and load account data from a source into IdentityNow.

Whenever IdentityNow is in the process of aggregating a source, it adds an entry to the Aggregation Activity Log, along with its relevant details.
To view aggregation activity, administrators can select the Connections drop-down menu, select Sources, and select the relevant source, select its Import Data tab, and select Account Aggregation.
In Account Aggregation, administrators can view the account aggregations' statuses and details in the Account Activity Log.

Refer to [Loading Account Data](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/accounts/loading_data.html) for more information about account aggregations.
