The purpose of this API is to expose functionality for the manipulation of Transform objects.
Transforms are a form of configurable objects which define an easy way to manipulate attribute data without having
to write code. These endpoints don't require API calls to other resources, audit service is used for keeping track
of which users have made changes to the Transforms.

Refer to [Transforms](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/docs/transforms) for more information about transforms.
