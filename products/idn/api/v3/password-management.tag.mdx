Use this API to implement password management functionality.  
With this functionality in place, users can manage their identity passwords for all their applications.

In IdentityNow, users can select their names in the upper right corner of the page and use the drop-down menu to select Password Manager. 
Password Manager lists the user's identity's applications, possibly grouped to share passwords. 
Users can then select 'Change Password' to update their passwords. 

Grouping passwords allows users to update their passwords more broadly, rather than requiring them to update each password individually. 
Password Manager may list the applications and sources in the following groups:

- Password Group: This refers to a group of applications that share a password. 
For example, a user can use the same password for Google Drive, Google Mail, and YouTube. 
Updating the password for the password group updates the password for all its included applications.

- Multi-Application Source: This refers to a source with multiple applications that share a password. 
For example, a user can have a source, G Suite, that includes the Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Mail applications. 
Updating the password for the multi-application source updates the password for all its included applications. 

- Applications: These are applications that do not share passwords with other applications.

An organization may require some authentication for users to update their passwords. 
Users may be required to answer security questions or use a third-party authenticator before they can confirm their updates. 

Refer to [Managing Passwords](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/user-help/accounts/passwords.html) for more information about password management.
