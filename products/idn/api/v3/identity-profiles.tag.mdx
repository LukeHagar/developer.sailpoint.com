Use this API to implement identity profile functionality. 
With this functionality in place, administrators can view identity profiles and their configurations. 

Identity profiles represent the configurations that can be applied to identities as a way of granting them a set of security and access, as well as defining the mappings between their identity attributes and their source attributes.  

In IdentityNow, administrators can use the Identities drop-down menu and select Identity Profiles to view the list of identity profiles. 
This list shows some details about each identity profile, along with its status. 
They can select an identity profile to view its settings, its mappings between identity attributes and correlating source account attributes, and its provisioning settings. 

Refer to [Creating Identity Profiles](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_profiles.html) for more information about identity profiles.
